## Abstract

As cyber threats continually evolve, the need for advanced malware detection and classification methods becomes paramount. This paper investigates the application of natural language processing (NLP)-based $n$-gram analysis and machine learning techniques to enhance malware classification. We explore how NLP can be used to extract and analyze textual features from malware samples through $n$-grams, contiguous string or API call sequences. This approach effectively captures distinctive linguistic patterns among malware and benign families, enabling finer-grained classification. We delve into $n$-gram size selection, feature representation, and classification algorithms. While evaluating our proposed method on real-world malware samples, we observe significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. By implementing our $n$-gram approach, we achieved an accuracy of 99.02\% across various machine learning algorithms by using a hybrid feature selection technique to address high dimensionality. The hybrid feature selection technique reduces the feature set to only 1.6\% of the original features. Our research contributes to the malware classification field, enhancing cybersecurity defenses against evolving threats.
